#  Hi, I’m Abhijeet Singh Pawar

**Data Analyst | Risk & Business Analytics**

I’m a data professional with experience in **analytics, predictive modeling, and business decision support**, backed by a **Master’s degree in Computer Engineering**. I work across the full data lifecycle — from **SQL-based data extraction and EDA** to **machine learning models, dashboards, and actionable insights**.

I’m actively seeking **Data Analyst and Data Scientist roles**, with interests in **risk analytics, customer behavior, and data-driven decision-making**.



##  What I Work On
- Business & Risk Analytics (Credit Risk, Churn, Customer Segmentation)
- SQL & Python-based Data Analysis
- Predictive Modeling & Machine Learning
- Dashboards & KPI Reporting (Power BI)
- End-to-End Analytics Pipelines



##  Featured Projects

###  Credit Card Credit Risk Modeling & Approval Strategy  
**Python | Statistics | Risk Analytics**
- Analyzed ~30K customer records to identify key default risk drivers
- Built an interpretable **Probability of Default (PD)** model with risk bands
- Evaluated using **ROC-AUC (~0.70+) and KS (~0.30+)**
- Designed PD-based approval cutoffs and simulated portfolio-level impact
